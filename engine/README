This file is a part of DARFI project

The engine directory contains files with classes and methods related to
the actual calculation. On this stage calculation includes several parts:


- cell detection and segmentation

- the proper image normalization and brightness scaling algorithm for
further calculation and data presentation

- fluorescent foci detection and calculation of their properties

- generation of the output images



The engine directory contains several files:


- pic_an.py

This file contains the basic classes (cell, cell_set and image_dir),
which should be used externally for image loading and saving, performing 
calculations.

- pic_an_calc.py

This file contains some internal functions which should not be used
explicitly in most cases.

- pic_an_dir.py

This file contains sample functions which run calculations and save the
results.

- pic_an_settings.py

This file contains the classes related to calculation settings 
(setting and settings). These classes are not used for calculations
themselves. All the options are to be passed to the functions in
pic_an.py as arguments. The classes from pic_an_settings.py should
be used for higher level calculation options implementation.



Here the available calculation options are going to be discussed in 
more details. All the options should be passed as arguments to the 
methods of cell_set and image_dir instances.

The options list:


######################### nuclei_name #############################

type 'unicode'

should be passed to:

pic_an.image_dir.__init__(nuclei_name=nuclei_name)

The name mask for the files used for cell (or nuclei) detection


########################## foci_name ##############################

type 'unicode'

should be passed to:

pic_an.image_dir.__init__(nuclei_name=nuclei_name)

The name mask for the files used for cell (or nuclei) detection


########################## outfile ################################

type 'unicode'

should be passed to:

pic_an.cell_set.write_parameters(outfilename=outfile)

The name for the calculation results for the cell_set given


####################### sensitivity ###############################

type 'int'

range: 0 to 10

default: 8

should be passed to:

pic_an.image_dir.load_separate_images(sensitivity = sensitivity)

The sensitivity of the cell detection algorithm. Default value is 8.
If sensitivity is low, some blurred cell edges could be missed, but
if the value is high the noise can cause false cell detection.


###################### cell_min_size ##############################

type 'int'

range: 0 to 4294967296

default: 8

should be passed to:

pic_an.image_dir.load_separate_images(cell_min_size = cell_min_size)

The minimum area of the cell in pixels. The objects with area below
this level are removed during cell detection algorithm.


#################### peak_min_val_perc ############################

type 'float'

range: 0. to 100.

default: 60.

should be passed to:

pic_an.cell_set.calculate_foci(peak_min_val_perc = peak_min_val_perc)

Only the points brighter than peak_min_val_perc percentile of the foci
picture points can be the seeds for further foci search.


#################### foci_min_val_perc ############################

type 'float'

range: 0. to 100.

default: 90.

should be passed to:

pic_an.cell_set.calculate_foci(foci_min_val_perc = foci_min_val_perc)

Only the points brighter than foci_min_val_perc percentile of the foci
vicinity points can be considered as foci points.


####################### foci_radius ###############################

type 'int'

range: 0 to 4294967296

default: 10

should be passed to:

pic_an.cell_set.calculate_foci(foci_radius = foci_radius)

The radius of the focus vicinity around the foci seed, in which foci
point search is performed.


################### foci_min_level_on_bg ##########################

type 'int'

range: 0 to 255

default: 40

should be passed to:

pic_an.cell_set.calculate_foci(foci_min_level_on_bg = foci_min_level_on_bg)

The minimal difference between the brightnesses of the focus points and 
background points of the focus vicinity. The background level is equal to
the 20th percentile brightness of the foci vicinity points.


##################### foci_rescale_min ############################
##################### foci_rescale_max ############################

type 'float'

range: 0. to 255.

default: None

should be passed to:

pic_an.cell_set.rescale_foci(foci_rescale_values=(foci_rescale_min, foci_rescale_max))

These parameters determine the minimum and maximum values for foci
picture rescaling. If None is given the values are obtained using
pic_an.cell_set.get_foci_rescale_values()


####################### nuclei_color ##############################

type 'float'

range: 0. to 1.

default: 0.66

should be passed to:

pic_an.image_dir.write_all_pic_files(nuclei_color=nuclei_color)

Hue of the cell (nucleus) points on the final merged picture.


######################## foci_color ###############################

type 'float'

range: 0. to 1.

default: 0.33

should be passed to:

pic_an.image_dir.write_all_pic_files(nuclei_color=nuclei_color)

Hue of the foci points on the final merged picture.
