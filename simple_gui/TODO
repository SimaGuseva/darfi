This file contains the list of GUI related things to do in near future.
If an issue was soved, it should be removed from the list below immediately.


TODO list:

- isolate settings from main widget class


Features list:

- save/load current settings capability. Restore settings from previous
session

- add explicit "detect cells" button. It should start image_dir.detect_nuclei()
for directories selected.

- image_dirs should be created once after the workdir is selected. Only those
directories which contain at least an image with nuclei have to be loaded.
