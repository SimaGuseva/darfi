This file contains the list of GUI related things to do in near future.
If an issue was soved, it should be removed from the list below immediately.


TODO list:


- enable common checkbox

- save/load current settings capability. Restore settings from previous
session

- "get scale from selection" button should set the scaling parameters from the 
last calculation if selection is unchanged instead of starting the same
calculation again

- add a plus button near each folder in the list which would cause the list of
images in the directory appear. After a click on an image file, the respective
image should be maximized to the whole image view area. If a directory was
clicked again, the small previews of all images from the directory should
reappear

- add "save session" feature

- add explicit "detect cells" button. It should start image_dir.detect_nuclei()
for directories selected.

- image_dirs should be created once after the workdir is selected. Only those
directories which contain at least an image with nuclei have to be loaded.
